            <div class="about-me-title">
                <span> I'm <strong>Sherin Olivia</strong>, Geeky Hobbyist</span>
                <p> Currently enrolled in RevoU's Full Stack Software Engineering course 
                    aspiring to become a <strong>Software Engineer</strong>. In my spare time, 
                    I'm a gamer and a wannabe writer. My go-to outdoor activities are 
                    walking in the park and visiting museums and galleries, I enjoy documenting 
                    these activities through the lense of my mobile phone.</p>

                    <img src="assets/icons/controller.svg" alt="an image symbolizing my hobby in gaming" />
                    <p> I tend to resonate well with games that have great focus on lore 
                        and character developments, along with unique mechanism.
                        Some of my favourites include but not limited to Watch_Dogs 2, 
                        Assassin's Creed, The Witcher 3, Path to Nowhere (mobile).</p>

                    <img src="assets/icons/pen.svg" alt="an image symbolizing my hobby in writing" />
                    <p> Perhaps because I'm introverted, that I'm not good with spoken words. 
                        Hence, I pour my thoughts into writings such as poems and epiphanies, 
                        to untangle my mind that unfortunately often contradicts--or questions 
                        the common views of the society. I'm in no way is a rebel, but as an agnostic, 
                        I do especially well in questioning.</p>

                    <p> In an effort to preserve positive events and or activities, I try to delve 
                        into photography, albeit in a very humble manner. All for the purpose that if 
                        I were to come across those photographs, I would be able to reminisce on the 
                        happy memories behind it and feel motivated to continuously do my best so I can 
                        create more of those happy memories in real time.</p>
